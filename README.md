# pwrswtch

The pwrswtch connects to a [Hamlib](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib) `rigctld` server and sets the power level and the PTT of the connected transceiver. This is handy if the power setting of your transceiver is hidden within an "elaborate" menu structure and you don't want to tune your antenna with 100 Watts.
